There are two select queries here: The first one gives you album titles and song titles
This is a left join on Album and Song. Therefore everything in Album will come back.
The second one give album titles and song titles as well. But this one is a left join on Song and Album.
So you get everything in Song back. By taking the union of the results of both queries, you essentially get all the data in
the Album table and Song table joined on the column AlbumId. We are only interested in the title of
the song and the album so from all the data, we ask for those two columns.
